# Surface Integrals

Surface integrals evaluate a function over a surface in a scalar or vector field, extending the concept of integration to two-dimensional surfaces in three-dimensional space.

## Types
1. Surface integral with respect to surface area: $\iint_S f(x,y,z) \, dS$
2. Surface integral of a vector field (flux): $\iint_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS$

## Key Properties
- Requires parametrization of the surface or normal vectors
- Measures total quantity over a surface (e.g., total flux, total mass)
- Surface elements can be computed using cross products

## Applications
- Flux in electromagnetism (Gauss's law)
- Heat flow across surfaces
- Fluid flow through surfaces
