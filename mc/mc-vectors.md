# Vectors in ℝⁿ

Vectors in ℝⁿ are fundamental objects in multivariable calculus representing magnitude and direction.

## Key Properties
- Vectors can be represented as ordered n-tuples: $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$
- Vector operations include addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product
- The standard basis vectors are denoted $\hat{e}_1, \hat{e}_2, ..., \hat{e}_n$

## Applications
- Describing position, velocity, and acceleration
- Representing forces and other physical quantities
- Forming the foundation for [[mc-vector-fields|vector fields]]
