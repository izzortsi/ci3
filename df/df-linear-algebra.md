# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces and linear mappings between them, providing the essential foundation for differential forms and much of modern mathematics.

## Key Concepts
- Vector spaces
- Linear transformations
- Bases and dimension
- Inner products
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Determinants

## Significance for Differential Forms
- Vectors and covectors (dual vectors)
- Multilinear functions and tensors
- Alternating forms and determinants
- Canonical isomorphisms

## Applications
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Geometric transformations
- Principal component analysis
- Quantum mechanics
- Machine learning
