# Topology

Topology is the study of properties preserved under continuous deformations (such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing), providing a framework for understanding space in a very general setting.

## Definition
A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying:
1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal{T}$
2. The union of any collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$
3. The intersection of any finite collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$

## Key Concepts
- Open and closed sets
- Topological spaces
- Basis for a topology
- Separation axioms
- Connectedness and compactness

## Examples
- Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Discrete topology
- Indiscrete topology
- Metric topology
