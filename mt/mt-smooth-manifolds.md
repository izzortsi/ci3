# Smooth Manifolds

Smooth manifolds are manifolds where transitions between charts are infinitely differentiable, allowing for calculus operations like differentiation and integration.

## Definition
A smooth manifold is a manifold $M$ equipped with a maximal atlas where all transition maps are $C^\infty$ (infinitely differentiable).

## Key Properties
- Admits smooth functions, vector fields, and differential forms
- Supports calculus operations like differentiation and integration
- Has a well-defined tangent space at each point
- Can have additional geometric structures (Riemannian metrics, symplectic forms, etc.)

## Examples
- Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$
- Spheres $S^n$
- Lie groups
- Cotangent bundles

## Applications
- Classical mechanics (phase spaces)
- General relativity (spacetime)
- Gauge theory in physics
- Morse theory
